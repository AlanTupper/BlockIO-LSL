DogeAPI-LSL
===========

A LSL script for Dogecoin transactions using DogeAPI

Ready for use in vendor systems, uses link messages to communicate with other scripts.  See the test file for clues on how the API works. (Will document later!)

Works with vanilla Opensimulator/SL/Whitecore.

Requires a notecard named DogeAPI_Config in the object's inventory.  This contains the API key for the seller's DogeAPI account.  Probably a good idea to lock that cards permissions down.
